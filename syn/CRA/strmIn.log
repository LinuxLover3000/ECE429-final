INFO (XSTRM-289): Performing automatic layer mapping because either the layer mapping information is not provided or the XST_AUTO_LM  value is used with the '-layerMap' option.
WARNING (XSTRM-107): Existing cells in the target library will be overwritten if the cell names in the Stream file and the target library are the same. To prevent this, set the '-writeMode' option to 'noOverwrite'.
INFO (XSTRM-163): You have not used the '-viaMap' option. If a viaMap file, corresponding technology file or technology library exist, then use the '-viaMap' option for creating oaVia instances in the Streamed-In library. Using the '-viaMap' option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.

INFO (XSTRM-80075): Via detection cannot use a stdViaDef for "cpu_VIA3" due to rounding errors. A customViaDef has been used instead. Use the -dbuPerUU option to increase the DBUperUU to enable detection of stdViaDef.
INFO (XSTRM-80075): Via detection cannot use a stdViaDef for "cpu_VIA4" due to rounding errors. A customViaDef has been used instead. Use the -dbuPerUU option to increase the DBUperUU to enable detection of stdViaDef.
INFO (XSTRM-80075): Via detection cannot use a stdViaDef for "cpu_VIA14" due to rounding errors. A customViaDef has been used instead. Use the -dbuPerUU option to increase the DBUperUU to enable detection of stdViaDef.
INFO (XSTRM-80075): Via detection cannot use a stdViaDef for "cpu_VIA15" due to rounding errors. A customViaDef has been used instead. Use the -dbuPerUU option to increase the DBUperUU to enable detection of stdViaDef.
WARNING (XSTRM-284): DbuPerUU (1000) specified in the technology database or using '-dbuPerUU' is not divisible by the value (2000) set in the GDSII file. This can cause loss in data precision during translation.
